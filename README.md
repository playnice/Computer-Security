# Computer-Security
Numerous type of ciphers had been created since ancient times until now. In this assignment, we will be implementing both classic symmetric ciphers and modern symmetric cipher. Classic symmetric ciphers we implemented are Vigenère Cipher (Polyalphabetic) and Additive Cipher (Mono-alphabetic). Modern symmetric cipher implemented is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). We will be comparing time complexity between Vigenère Cipher and Additive Cipher. Also, we will inject bit error into AES ciphertext to investigate effects of bit errors on transmitted ciphertext.
